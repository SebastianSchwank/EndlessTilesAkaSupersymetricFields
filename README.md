# EndlessTilesAkaSupersymetricFields
this is my first approach to model a programm for endless fields


Here we are the first programm written in QtC++ for simulating a 2Dimensional repeating/endless/symetric - space with point charges in it
which interact with each other in realtime.

Here's a screenshot for previewing the programm:
